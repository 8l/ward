There are two seperate lattices which are used in ward simultainiously,
	The Root Lattice
      		The root lattice is the lattice generated by the program, It's
		The 1 to 1, true lattice of the program. 
	The Display Lattice
		The dispaly lattice is a simplified, readable, version of the
		Root Lattice, it's much smaller and easier to display.


The root lattice is generated with the following algorithm
	(1)start at the programs entry point
	(2)read through each of the opcodes into a new element, where
		#Jumps(conditional or unconditional) mark the end of an element
		#Jumps lead to the next location with one line
		#conditional jumps 'fork'
		#jumps are stored as an elements destination
	(3)starting at unhandled destinations, go to step 2.

The display lattice is generated by the following algorithm
	(1)combine all elements linked with unconditional jumps
	(2)combine elements with the lowest value, repeatedly until some 
		desired number of elements is meet.
